### Creating a Local Virtual Environment

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your Python projects to manage dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using the following commands:

1. Install virtualenv with pip:
```
pip install virtualenv
```

2. Create a new virtual environment named `.venv`
```
python -m venv .venv
```

3. Activate the new virtual environment
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If this isn't helpful go to [this website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/),

### Installation of Packages

After creating and activating the virtual environment, you can install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file provided with the project. Run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
